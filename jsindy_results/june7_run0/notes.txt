Notes from fixes from the june6_fixed run:
Decrease initial variance estimate in preoptimizing initialization,increase gradient descent iterations
Decrease the minimum alpha in LM optimizer
Fix ourselves to 500 collocation points


This fixed the problem with dt = 0.2, but didn't make any different for noisy cases

ALSO:
Accidentally saved a couple of runs from the next run in this folder, 
don't rerun analysis results without going back to the old commit.
